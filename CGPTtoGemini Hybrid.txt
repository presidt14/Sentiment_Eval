use the following txt to re-evaluate and restructure the earlier sentiment analysis plan:Below is a work-focused summary, followed by a concise analysis, actions, and an evaluation framework.
I’ve stripped out personal asides and kept only operational, product, and delivery-relevant content.

1. Work-Only Summary (Extracted)
The discussion covers two workstreams:
A. Sentiment Analysis for Social Monitoring (Trackback)


Current third-party sentiment tools (BrandMentions, Dizio, Ringali/WhoPod) are inaccurate, especially on short or low-information posts.


Many posts with only 3–4 words or links are auto-tagged as negative when they should be ignored.


Primary business need is identifying genuinely negative sentiment (not positive/neutral) that:


Mentions or links to a client brand (e.g. Kraken)


Has sufficient text to infer meaning


Is actionable enough to surface in Trackback’s Actions Dashboard




Desired outcome: generate action cards such as:

“A social post linking to Kraken shows clear negative sentiment.”



Preference to own and control sentiment logic rather than relying on vendors.


Recognition that training, thresholds, and filtering rules will be required.


Need to benchmark results against existing tools to validate improvement.


B. Internal Documentation Quality & Structure


Large internal documentation set (≈352 pages) combining:


Technical system notes


Customer Success (CS) operational guidance




Content is valuable but:


Poorly structured


Mixed audiences


Difficult to navigate and reuse




CS onboarding and report setup currently relies on memory/guesswork.


Goal is not wholesale rewrite blindly, but:


Define “what good looks like” per audience


Potentially use AI to restructure, summarise, and separate content




Tools mentioned as candidates:


NotebookLM (large-context ingestion)


AI-assisted rewriting




Need alignment with Nicole / CS team on desired outputs before proceeding.



2. Analysis (Critical, Work-Focused)
Sentiment Analysis
Core problem:
Current vendors optimise for volume tagging, not actionable signal detection.
Key insight:
Sentiment analysis is only useful when embedded in a decision system (Actions Dashboard). Raw polarity scores are insufficient.
Risk:
Naively applying LLM sentiment to noisy, short-form posts will replicate the same flaws unless:


Minimum text thresholds are enforced


Confidence scoring is explicit


“Ignore” becomes a first-class output state



Documentation
Core problem:
The documentation is grown organically from the author’s mental model, not from user needs.
Key insight:
This is not a tooling problem; it’s an information architecture problem.
Risk:
Bulk AI rewriting without defining:


target readers


usage scenarios


success criteria
will produce polished but unusable output.



3. Recommended Actions (Concrete & Sequenced)
A. Sentiment Analysis – Immediate Actions (Next 2–3 weeks)


Define hard filters before ML


Minimum word count (e.g. ≥12 words)


Must contain brand mention OR verified outbound link


Exclude pure link drops / emojis / hashtags only




Limit scope deliberately


Single task: detect clear negative sentiment only


Outputs: negative | ignore | uncertain


No positive tagging initially




Build a small evaluation set


100–200 historical posts


Human-labelled by relevance + sentiment


Used for side-by-side comparison with BrandMentions/Dizio




Integrate only into Actions Dashboard


No raw sentiment UI


Only surface when confidence ≥ threshold





B. Documentation – Immediate Actions (Next 2–4 weeks)


Define audiences and outcomes


CS: “How do I onboard and set up reports correctly?”


Technical: “How does the system behave and connect?”




Run a pilot, not a rewrite


Select 10–15 high-value pages


Rewrite into:


CS-only version


Technical reference version






Validate with users


Give pilot output to Nicole + one CS user


Ask: “Does this reduce questions/errors?”




Only then scale with AI


Use NotebookLM / similar once structure is agreed


AI becomes an accelerator, not a discovery tool





4. Evaluation Framework
Sentiment Analysis – Success Criteria
✅ Reduction in false negatives surfaced
✅ Fewer irrelevant action cards
✅ CS/compliance teams trust alerts enough to act
✅ Clear improvement vs existing vendors on same data set
Documentation – Success Criteria
✅ Faster CS onboarding
✅ Reduced “how did we do this last time?” reliance
✅ Fewer Slack/Ad-hoc clarifications
✅ Clear separation of CS vs technical knowledge

Bottom Line (On balance)
On balance, the priority should be owning a narrow, high-signal sentiment detector tightly coupled to actions, not chasing generic sentiment accuracy.
In parallel, documentation work should start with structure and user intent, not mass AI rewriting.
Both initiatives are strong candidates for AI assistance — but only after constraints and success criteria are nailed down. 
ChatGPT said:
Below is a re-evaluated and fully restructured version of the earlier sentiment-analysis plan, now incorporating the new work-focused summary.
It follows your instructed “Critical Synthesizer” pattern: deconstruct → perspectives → critique → synthesis → on-balance conclusion.
It stays concise and practical.

1. Deconstruct the Premise
We want to improve Trackback’s sentiment accuracy because current vendors over-tag low-information posts as negative.
The business need is not generic sentiment classification — it’s high-precision detection of meaningful negative sentiment tied to client brands, which must feed into the Actions Dashboard.

Separately, a large body of internal documentation exists but is poorly structured. The need is not rewriting everything, but creating a clear information architecture split between CS and Technical audiences, then scaling with AI.

Underlying assumptions to test:

More data ≠ more usefulness; filtering may matter more.

Good documentation ≠ long documentation; clarity, separation, and navigability matter most.

AI is an amplifier, not a compass; it should execute a structure, not discover one.

2. Steel-Man Perspectives
Perspective A — The ML-First Optimizer
“Let’s use LLMs to classify everything. More sophisticated models will outperform the current vendors. Train/tune, then integrate the results.”

Perspective B — The Decision-System Pragmatist
“Sentiment is only useful when it produces actionable signals. Prioritise filtering, thresholds, and integration into the Actions Dashboard. Ignore 80% of noise.”

Perspective C — The Data Purist
“Before ML, define the input criteria. Short posts, link-only drops, and emoji-only posts must be filtered out. A meaningful input stream is worth more than the best model.”

Perspective D — The Documentation Architect
“For internal docs, the problem is structure and purpose. Without defining audiences and outcomes, AI rewriting will just create polished chaos.”

3. Critical Analysis of Each Perspective
A — ML-First Optimizer
Strengths:

Can explore modern models (Gemma, DeepSeek, Claude) and likely outperform current vendors.

Flexible for future multi-class sentiment or brand safety use cases.

Weaknesses:

Will replicate vendor errors if fed noisy, low-information posts.

Requires evaluation data, labelling discipline, and careful calibration.

Consequence:
High effort, low payoff unless inputs are filtered first.

B — Decision-System Pragmatist
Strengths:

Focuses on why sentiment matters: producing fewer, more trustworthy action cards.

Encourages confidence thresholds, “ignore” as a valid state, and explicit linkage to brands.

Weaknesses:

May seem limited in scope at first.

Needs strong internal conviction about not classifying everything.

Consequence:
Maximises business value while minimising risk of noisy outputs.

C — Data Purist
Strengths:

Establishes deterministic rules upfront: minimum words, brand presence, exclusion lists.

Reduces classification load and increases quality of model signals.

Weaknesses:

Hard filters may miss some edge cases.

Some subjective tuning required.

Consequence:
Provides the foundation that makes any ML layer effective.

D — Documentation Architect
Strengths:

Recognises this is an information architecture issue, not a rewriting problem.

Advocates small pilots, audience segmentation, and validation loops.

Weaknesses:

Requires agreement from CS and stakeholders before scaling.

No “instant fix” appeal.

Consequence:
Produces documentation that reduces errors and supports onboarding.

4. Synthesis & Key Tensions
Across all perspectives, a clear tension emerges:

Are we trying to tag everything, or only surface meaningful, high-confidence negatives?

All evidence from the work summary and operations leads to the latter.

For documentation, the tension is similar:

Do we rewrite everything now, or define structure and validate with users first?

Again: structure must precede scale.

Both initiatives share a principle:

The quality of the output is constrained more by upstream structure than downstream AI.

5. Restructured, Practical Plan (Updated)
A. Sentiment Analysis (Trackback)
Phase 1 — Define & Filter (1–2 weeks)
Minimum text length (≥12 words).

Must contain brand mention or resolvable link.

Exclude link-only, emoji-only, hashtag-only, “promo” noise.

Define exact output states: negative | uncertain | ignore.

Phase 2 — Ground Truth Set (1 week)
Curate 100–200 historical posts.

Human label for relevance + sentiment.

Freeze the dataset for vendor comparison.

Phase 3 — Model Comparison (1 week)
Test Gemma, Claude, DeepSeek on the filtered set.

Measure: precision, recall, false positives, false negatives.

Select the model with highest precision for negative.

Phase 4 — Integration with Actions Dashboard (2 weeks)
Only surface results when:

confidence ≥ threshold

relevance = true

No raw sentiment UI; Trackback shows actions, not scores.

Capture metrics: action-card precision, vendor vs in-house comparison.

B. Internal Documentation
Phase 1 — Define Information Architecture (1 week)
Two tracks: CS Operational vs Technical Reference.

Define success criteria for each.

Phase 2 — Pilot Rewrite (1–2 weeks)
Select 10–15 high-impact pages.

Produce CS-only and Technical versions.

Keep all transformation rules documented.

Phase 3 — User Validation (1 week)
Review with Nicole + 1–2 CS staff.

Measure whether onboarding/questions improve.

Phase 4 — Scale with AI (3–5 weeks)
Use NotebookLM / Gemini / GPT for structured rewriting.

Maintain folder-level architecture.

6. Updated Evaluation Metrics
Sentiment
↓ Irrelevant action cards

↓ False negatives

↑ CS trust in alerts

Side-by-side superiority vs BrandMentions/Dizio

Documentation
Faster onboarding

Fewer “how did we do this last time?” questions

Clear CS-vs-tech separation

Improved search/navigation

7. On Balance (Final Conclusion)
On balance, the highest value lies in owning a narrow but precise negative-sentiment detector built on strong filtering and evaluation, not attempting generic polarity classification.

In parallel, internal documentation should begin with audience segmentation and structural design, not a mass AI rewrite.

AI will deliver strong leverage in both areas only after constraints, filters, and desired outcomes are explicitly defined.

If you want, I can now deliver a full execution plan, a prototype evaluation dataset schema, or a prompt pack for testing Gemma vs DeepSeek vs Claude.

7. On Balance (Final Conclusion)

On balance, the highest value lies in owning a narrow but precise negative-sentiment detector built on strong filtering and evaluation, not attempting generic polarity classification.

In parallel, internal documentation should begin with audience segmentation and structural design, not a mass AI rewrite.

AI will deliver strong leverage in both areas only after constraints, filters, and desired outcomes are explicitly defined.

If you want, I can now deliver a full execution plan, a prototype evaluation dataset schema, or a prompt pack for testing Gemma vs DeepSeek vs Claude.

Here is a critical analysis of your proposed plan, followed by an optimized alternative strategy.

Part 1: Critical Analysis of the Proposed Plan
Your plan is operationally sound but technically rigid. It successfully moves away from "AI magic" toward business value, but it swings too far into deterministic rule-making (hard filters), which risks discarding high-signal data in a modern social media context.

1. The "Length Fallacy" (Crucial Weakness)
You propose a hard filter: Minimum text length (≥12 words). Critique: In social media sentiment analysis, brevity often correlates with intensity.

Example: "This is a scam." (4 words) or "Trackback is down again?" (5 words).

The Risk: By filtering Length<12, you achieve high precision but suffer from catastrophic recall loss on high-urgency incidents.

Mathematical Reality: If S is sentiment intensity and L is length, the relationship is often non-linear. High ∣S∣ often exists at low L.

2. The Context Blind Spot
You propose: Must contain brand mention or resolvable link. Critique: High-value negative sentiment often occurs in threaded replies where the brand is not explicitly named again.

Scenario:

Brand Post: "Check out our new feature!"

User Reply: "It’s completely broken for me. Fix it." (No brand name, <12 words).

Result: Your plan ignores this actionable negative signal.

3. Documentation: The "Static Snapshot" Trap
You propose: Phase 4 — Scale with AI (Rewrite). Critique: Rewriting documentation using AI creates a "snapshot in time." Without a governance system or a "Docs-as-Code" approach for the Technical side, the documentation will rot the moment the AI finishes writing it. The plan lacks a Maintenance Lifecycle.

Part 2: The Alternative Improved Plan
This plan shifts from "Hard Filters" to a "Cascading Filter" approach and prioritizes Context Awareness.

Strategic Pivot
Sentiment: Move from Length-based filtering to Complexity-based routing.

Docs: Move from Rewriting to componentizing (Single Source of Truth).

A. Sentiment Analysis (The "Cascading Context" Method)
Phase 1: Contextual Data Ingestion (Weeks 1–2)
Instead of filtering by length, we filter by thread relevance.

Logic: If a post is a reply, fetch the parent post.

The Check: Does the Parent or the Post contain the Brand Keyword? If yes, keep.

Junk Filter: maintain your strict exclusion of "Promo/Giveaway/NFT" noise, but remove the word count limit.

Phase 2: The "Triage" Classifier (Week 2)
Do not send every post to a large, slow LLM (Claude/Opus). Use a cheap, fast model (e.g., DistilBERT or a tiny Llama-3-8B quantified) for the first pass.

Classification: C(x)∈{Likely Spam,Neutral,Potentially Actionable}

Rule: If Likely Spam or Neutral, discard. If Potentially Actionable, pass to Phase 3.

Phase 3: The LLM Judge (Precision Layer) (Week 3)
Send only the "Potentially Actionable" candidates to a stronger model (e.g., GPT-4o-mini or Claude Haiku).

Prompt Structure: "Analyze the sentiment of this text specifically regarding [Brand Name]. Ignore tone regarding outside topics."

Output JSON:

{"sentiment":"Negative","confidence":0.95,"urgency":"High","topic":"Downtime"}
Phase 4: Feedback Loop Integration (Week 4)
Instead of just a dashboard, build a correction mechanism.

Action: When a CS agent dismisses a card as "irrelevant," that ID and text are saved to a specific dataset.

Outcome: This creates a "gold standard" adversarial dataset to fine-tune the Phase 2 model later.

B. Internal Documentation (The "Living Docs" Method)
Phase 1: Automated Audit & Clustering (Week 1)
Don't start by defining architecture manually. Let AI analyze the mess.

Action: Ingest all current docs into a vector store. Cluster them by semantic similarity.

Goal: Identify duplicate content (e.g., "How to reset API key" appearing in 5 different docs).

Phase 2: Source Separation (Week 2)
Technical Docs: Move to Docs-as-Code (Markdown files in a Git repo). This ensures docs are updated when code is updated.

CS Docs: Move to a knowledge base (Notion/Zendesk) optimized for search.

Phase 3: The "SME Interview" Synthesis (Weeks 3–4)
AI rewriting existing bad docs just makes "polished bad docs."

Action: Record short Loom videos or transcripts of SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) explaining the current truth of complex features.

Synthesis: Use LLMs to transcribe the video and generate the documentation from the fresh explanation, not the old text.

Part 3: Comparative Analysis
Feature	Your Original Plan	Improved Alternative Plan
Noise Filtering	Hard rules (Length < 12 words). High Risk of missing data.	Cascading Logic: Cheap model filters noise; Expensive model judges sentiment.
Context	Single-post isolation.	Thread-aware: Ingests parent posts for context.
Model Strategy	Compare 3 LLMs, pick one.	Hybrid: Small model for speed/volume, LLM for precision.
Documentation	Rewrite existing text.	Fresh Synthesis: Generate docs from SME transcripts/code comments.
Maintenance	Not defined.	Docs-as-Code (Tech) + Feedback Loops (CS).
Part 4: The Next Step
The most critical upgrade in the alternative plan is the Cascading Architecture for sentiment. It solves the cost vs. quality tension.

Would you like me to generate the specific System Prompt for the "Phase 3 LLM Judge" that includes the instructions for handling short, high-context negatives (e.g., sarcasm or thread replies)?

yes please whilst taking into account the Sentiment Analysis content of the attached document for additional context.

Based on your original constraints and the specific frustrations voiced in the transcript regarding current vendors like BrandMentions and Dizio, here is the optimized System Prompt for "Phase 3."

Why this prompt works (based on your transcript)

Solves the "Short Post" Issue: You specifically noted that current vendors tag "three or four words and a link" as negative, which creates noise. This prompt explicitly penalizes low-context link drops.


Focuses on the "Actions Dashboard": You stated the goal is to populate "task cards" for things the team explicitly needs to look at. This prompt introduces an actionability_score to distinguish between "general grumbling" and "requires intervention."


Context Aware: It accounts for your edge case example ("Don't gamble guys"), which you decided was "quite interesting" and worth including even if not an emergency.

System Prompt: The "Risk & Action" Judge
Model Configuration: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Llama-3-70B (High Precision) Temperature: 0.2 (Low creativity, high consistency)

Markdown
### ROLE
You are a Senior Brand Risk Analyst for Trackback. Your job is not just to detect "sentiment" (positive/negative), but to detect "actionability" for a Client Success Actions Dashboard.

### INPUT DATA
You will receive a JSON object containing:
1. "post_text": The content of the social post.
2. "parent_text": The text of the post this is replying to (if applicable).
3. "brand_name": The client brand being monitored (e.g., Kraken).

### THE CORE PROBLEM
Current market solutions fail because they tag short posts (e.g., "Check this out [Link]") as negative due to lack of positive keywords. This creates noise. You must filter this out.

### CLASSIFICATION RULES

1. **The "Vendor Noise" Filter (CRITICAL):**
   - If a post contains *only* a link and neutral/short text (e.g., "Read this," "Wow," "Look"), classify as NEUTRAL and IGNORE.
   - UNLESS the text contains explicit negative markers (e.g., "Scam [Link]", "Avoid [Link]").

2. **Context Resolution:**
   - Use parent_text to determine the target of the sentiment.
   - Example: If parent_text is the Brand announcing a feature, and post_text is "It's broken," this is HIGH urgency.

3. **Actionability Scoring (0-10):**
   - **0-3 (Ignore):** Spam, irrelevant promo, generic news, neutral link drops.
   - **4-6 (Monitor):** General negative sentiment, competitor mentions, "Don't gamble" warnings (Responsible Gaming).
   - **7-10 (Alert):** Technical failure claims ("Site down"), Scam accusations, broken links, direct user complaints asking for help.

### OUTPUT JSON SCHEMA
{
  "sentiment": "Positive" | "Neutral" | "Negative",
  "is_link_drop_noise": boolean,
  "actionability_score": integer (0-10),
  "primary_topic": "Technical Issue" | "Scam/Security" | "General Feedback" | "Spam/Promo" | "Responsible Gaming",
  "summary": "Max 10 words explaining the flag"
}

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES

Input: 
{"brand_name": "Kraken", "post_text": "Check out this article http://link...", "parent_text": null}
Output:
{
  "sentiment": "Neutral",
  "is_link_drop_noise": true,
  "actionability_score": 0,
  "primary_topic": "Spam/Promo",
  "summary": "Neutral link drop"
}

Input: 
{"brand_name": "Kraken", "post_text": "Don't gamble guys, you'll lose everything.", "parent_text": null}
Output:
{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "is_link_drop_noise": false,
  "actionability_score": 5,
  "primary_topic": "Responsible Gaming",
  "summary": "General gambling warning, non-specific"
}

Input: 
{"brand_name": "Kraken", "post_text": "Just 4 words.", "parent_text": "Check out our new UI!"}
Output:
{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "is_link_drop_noise": false,
  "actionability_score": 8,
  "primary_topic": "General Feedback",
  "summary": "Sarcastic dismissal of new UI"
}

Input: 
{"brand_name": "Kraken", "post_text": "Still waiting on my withdrawal? verify me.", "parent_text": "We have 24/7 support!"}
Output:
{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "is_link_drop_noise": false,
  "actionability_score": 10,
  "primary_topic": "Technical Issue",
  "summary": "Unresolved support ticket/withdrawal"
}
Next Step for Execution
To validate this against your goal of comparing against BrandMentions, I recommend we take the Phase 2 — Ground Truth Set from your original plan and run this prompt against those 100-200 posts.

Would you like me to create a spreadsheet template for that "Ground Truth" test so you can side-by-side the Vendor Result vs. This Prompt's Result?




ChatGPT said:

Thought for 43s
Got it – I’ll treat Gemini’s “alternative plan” as a challenger to the earlier one and then propose a hybrid, improved version you can actually implement with your current realities (Trackback, internal Gemma, vendors, Actions Dashboard).

I’ll split this into:

Critical analysis of Gemini’s alternative plan (including the Phase 3 system prompt).

An improved hybrid plan (what I’d actually recommend you build).

1. Critical Analysis of Gemini’s Alternative Plan
1.1. Big strengths
a) Cascading architecture is conceptually right

Cheap triage → expensive “LLM judge” → Actions Dashboard is the right shape:

Controls cost.

Reduces noise.

Matches the idea of “only show CS something if it matters.”

Moving away from a dumb minimum-length filter is correct: short posts can be highly critical.

b) Context awareness is a key upgrade

Using parent_text for replies (e.g. “It’s broken” under a brand announcement) fixes a real blind spot.

Explicitly modelling actionability vs pure sentiment is aligned with your goal: Actions Dashboard, not a generic sentiment feed.

c) The Phase 3 “Risk & Action Judge” prompt is strong

It directly attacks your vendor pain points:

Penalises link-drop noise.

Adds actionability_score (0–10) and primary_topic.

Makes “Responsible Gaming” a distinct topic, which is important for your vertical.

JSON structure is implementation-friendly for Trackback.

d) Documentation “living docs” thinking is broadly right

Recognising “docs rot” and suggesting:

Docs-as-code for tech.

Proper KB for CS.

SME-driven updates rather than just polishing old junk.

That’s better than a one-off AI rewrite that ages badly.

1.2. Key weaknesses / risks
Weakness 1 – Over-engineered for Phase 1
You’re still at the “prove we can beat BrandMentions/Dizio” stage.

Gemini jumps straight to:

Thread resolution.

Dedicated triage model (DistilBERT / tiny Llama).

Feedback-loop training pipeline.

That’s a Phase 2/3 architecture. For your first experiments, it adds complexity and infra you don’t yet have:

You don’t currently run DistilBERT or small Llama models in production.

Your internal LLM is Gemma on AWS; the plan assumes easy use of GPT-4o/Claude, which may or may not be OK for client data.

Impact: High risk of analysis-paralysis + never getting to a simple, measurable side-by-side test with your vendor outputs.

Weakness 2 – Assumes reliable thread context you may not have
The plan leans heavily on parent_text:

That’s great if you pull raw posts from Twitter/X APIs with reply chains.

But your current workflow relies on 3rd-party tools (BrandMentions, Dizio, etc.), which may:

Not expose full thread context.

Truncate or normalise replies.

If you can’t reliably hydrate parent posts, the most clever piece of this design (context awareness) can’t be universally applied.

Impact: You end up with an architecture optimised for data you don’t always have.

Weakness 3 – “No length rule” is also too extreme
Gemini rightly calls out the “length ≥12” rule as too blunt – agreed.

But dropping length entirely is also naïve:

You do want to treat:

“Scam.”

“Shit.”

“Avoid.”

“Broken.”

Short slurs like “rigged”

differently from:

“Wow.”

“Hmm.”

“Look.”

Better framing:
Length shouldn’t be a hard filter, but it is a useful feature in a heuristic:

Short + strong negative keyword → send to judge.

Short + no sentiment keyword + only a link → auto-ignore.

Weakness 4 – Evaluation got pushed to the background
Your original plan was very clear on:

100–200 post ground truth set.

Human-labelled for relevance + sentiment.

Side-by-side comparison vs BrandMentions/Dizio.

Gemini’s plan mentions evaluation only vaguely at the end. This is dangerous:

Without a frozen test set and evaluation harness, you risk:

Overfitting to “feels better” rather than measured gains.

No clean story when you go back to Adam / leadership with numbers.

You need the eval harness as a non-negotiable spine.

Weakness 5 – Documentation plan is clever but a bit “AI-first”
Vector clustering on all internal docs before agreeing on any target IA can easily create:

Pretty clusters that don’t match how CS/Tech actually work.

SME video → LLM summarisation is powerful, but:

It’s heavy operationally.

You don’t need it for mundane areas that are already clear.

Missing: a simple ownership & review cadence:

Who owns CS docs?

Who owns tech docs?

How often are they reviewed?

2. Improved Hybrid Plan (What I’d Actually Build)
2.1. Sentiment: Hybrid of “filters + context + LLM judge + strong eval”
Think of this as “Your original plan 2.0” – simpler than Gemini’s architecture but borrowing its best ideas.

Phase 0 – Evaluation Backbone (non-negotiable)
Build the 100–200 post evaluation set now:

Include a mix of:

Short, intense complaints.

Link drops.

Threads/replies (where you do have context).

Responsible Gaming posts.

Neutral promos/news.

Label:

relevance_to_brand (true/false/maybe)

sentiment (neg/neu/pos)

actionability (0–10)

topic (technical / scam / RG / general / spam).

For every experiment you run:

Store: Vendor outputs + your pipeline outputs.

Compute: precision/recall for negative & actionable cases.

This keeps everything honest and gives you a story for Adam & leadership.

Phase 1 – Lightweight deterministic pre-filter
Keep this very simple and implementable:

Language / charset guardrails

E.g. only process English posts in v1 (if that matches business priority).

Spam/promo pattern filters

Regex / rules for:

Giveaways, promo codes, obvious SEO spam.

Short-post heuristic instead of hard cut-off

If length < 4 tokens AND:

No strong negative keyword: ignore.

Strong negative keyword: send to judge.

Brand/link rule

Prefer posts with:

Brand name, OR

Link that appears to go to brand domain (simple domain match).

Don’t strictly require it if:

The post is a reply to a brand tweet/post (where you have that context).

This keeps almost all the simplicity of your original “Phase 1” but avoids the “cut everything <12 words” trap.

Phase 2 – Optional context enrichment (where available)
Where APIs or vendor exports allow:

Attach:

parent_text

Possibly thread_root_text (brand announcement, campaign, etc.)

Fallback:

If you don’t have parent, feed only post_text to the judge.

Don’t build your entire architecture assuming context; treat it as an optional bonus feature.

Phase 3 – Single-stage LLM Judge (using the Gemini prompt, with tweaks)
Use the “Risk & Action Judge” prompt as your v1 production brain, with a few refinements:

Tweaks I’d make:

Add an explicit confidence field

e.g. confidence: 0.0–1.0

Use it + actionability_score to gate whether something becomes an Action Card.

Tighten allowed topics

primary_topic list should be:

"Technical Issue" | "Scam/Security" | "Responsible Gaming" | "General Experience" | "Spam/Promo" | "Other"

Reduces UI complexity and makes analytics easier.

Add a “why” snippet for debugging

E.g. rationale_snippet: max 20 words explaining the classification.

Useful during evaluation, even if you don’t show it to CS.

Guard explicitly against over-penalising brand-neutral link shares

Strengthen “Vendor Noise Filter” section:

If sentiment can’t be clearly tied to the brand (even using parent_text), treat as Neutral + actionability_score: 0–2.

Run this judge offline first against your evaluation set and vendor outputs. If you beat them clearly, then think about clever triage models.

Phase 4 – Only then consider cascading/triage models
Once you have:

Proven uplift vs BrandMentions/Dizio on the eval set, and

An idea of average LLM cost per 1k posts,

then:

Consider a small, cheap triage model (Gemma variant, small open-source) to separate:

Obvious spam/neutral vs “potentially actionable.”

Keep the LLM Judge only for the “potentially actionable” bucket.

But don’t start here. This is an optimisation phase, not a starting point.

Phase 5 – Feedback loop inside Trackback
Keep this minimal:

On every Action Card, allow CS to flag:

Good catch

Not relevant

Wrong topic/sentiment

Log these decisions to a table with the original post text + model output.

This gives you:

A live stream of adversarial cases.

Training data if you later fine-tune a small triage model.

2.2. Documentation: Merge IA-first + “living docs” without overkill
Here’s the hybrid I’d push:

Step 1 – IA and use-cases first (1 workshop + 1 doc)
With Nicole + 1 tech lead, define:

Top 5–10 CS tasks (onboard, configure, handle X scenario).

Top 5–10 Technical topics (architecture, integration, data flows).

Create a skeleton IA:

CS tree (“How do I…”)

Tech tree (“How it works…”)

Step 2 – Light AI audit, not heavy vector-cluster project
Use AI (Gemma / GPT) to:

Scan existing docs.

Suggest:

Duplicates.

Obvious candidates for each IA branch.

Don’t let it define the structure, just use it to populate the skeleton and highlight mess.

Step 3 – Ownership + format split
Tech:

Move to Markdown in Git (docs-as-code).

Owned by Engineering.

CS:

Move to a KB tool (Notion, Help Scout, whatever you use).

Owned by CS.

Add a simple rule: no new feature ships without at least a stub doc in both tracks if relevant.

Step 4 – Use SME video transcription only for gnarly areas
For complex flows (e.g. weird compliance edge cases, legacy systems), yes:

Record a 10–15 min SME walkthrough.

Transcribe with LLM.

Convert into CS + Tech docs.

Don’t waste that workflow on simple pages.

3. On-balance view
Gemini’s alternative plan is conceptually strong but too “Phase 3” for where you are.

The best plan for you now is a hybrid:

Keep your original emphasis on:

Evaluation set.

Narrow negative/actionable focus.

Integration into Actions Dashboard.

Borrow Gemini’s strengths:

Context-aware judging when possible.

Vendor noise filter.

Actionability scoring and topics.

Longer-term feedback loops and docs-as-code thinking.

If you’d like, next step I’d suggest is:

I draft:

A concrete evaluation spreadsheet schema (columns, labels, example rows).

A cleaned-up version of the Phase 3 LLM Judge system prompt with the tweaks above, ready to paste into Gemma/GPT.

You said:
the documentation section was part of a different project. Re-write taking this into account as i want my coding tool to focus only on the sentiment analysis project for now.
ChatGPT said:
Understood — here is the clean, rewritten analysis and improved plan with all documentation content removed so your coding tool (Cursor/Windsurf/Gemini MCP, etc.) focuses solely on the Sentiment Analysis Project.

1. Critical Analysis of Gemini’s Alternative Plan (Sentiment Only)
Gemini’s plan is a strong challenger, but not all of it fits your operational constraints, nor the immediate goal:
Prove that an in-house sentiment pipeline can beat BrandMentions/Dizio on actionable negative detection for Trackback.

Here is the critical breakdown.

1.1. Strengths
a) Cascading Architecture (Triage → LLM Judge)
This is theoretically excellent:

Cheap model removes obvious noise.

Expensive model handles nuance.

Output feeds directly into Trackback’s Actions Dashboard.

Conceptually, this aligns perfectly with your business goal:
Deliver fewer, higher-quality negative/actionable alerts.

b) Context Awareness (parent_text)
This is a major improvement over your initial plan.

Replies like “It’s broken” are only meaningful in context.

Vendors currently mishandle these cases.

Adding optional parent context strengthens precision.

c) Actionability Focus
The prompt Gemini gave moves beyond “sentiment = negative” to:

actionability_score

primary_topic

is_link_drop_noise

short rationale

This aligns extremely well with Trackback’s internal workflow and reduces false alarms.

d) Vendor Noise Filter
Explicitly solves your biggest operational pain:

Vendors over-tag short, low-information posts as negative.

By penalising:

link+short neutral text

“wow/this/look/read” posts

hashtag dumps

…the prompt substantially improves signal quality.

1.2. Weaknesses / Risks
Weakness 1 — Over-engineering too early
Gemini jumps immediately to:

triage model

parent hydration

feedback loop datasets

multi-stage ML pipeline

But right now, your real objective is:

Run a measurable head-to-head evaluation against BrandMentions/Dizio using a frozen 100–200 post dataset.

Before you prove uplift, building triage models and thread resolvers is premature engineering.

Weakness 2 — Assumes consistent availability of thread context
You may not always have:

parent posts

thread root text

the “brand announcement” context

Your ingestion comes from multiple external tools (BrandMentions, Dizio, etc.), and context availability is inconsistent.

Therefore, an LLM Judge that requires parent context is risky.

It should be optional.

Weakness 3 — Completely removing word-count checks is also flawed
While a hard ≥12 word rule was too restrictive, abandoning length as a signal entirely is naive.

In real Trackback data, short posts fall into two categories:

Highly negative / critical
(“Scam”, “Broken”, “Avoid”, “Rigged”, “Site down”, “Still waiting”, “Wtf Kraken”)

Completely neutral
(“Wow”, “Look”, “Hmm”, link-only)

Meaning:
Length is still a feature — just not a hard filter.

Weakness 4 — Evaluation methodology got diluted
Your original plan had very strong evaluation logic:

Frozen dataset.

Human labels.

Direct comparison vs vendors.

Precision/recall measured specifically for “negative actionable.”

Gemini’s rewrite pushes evaluation to the periphery.
This is dangerous — without rigorous eval:

You can’t demonstrate uplift to Adam or leadership.

You risk subjective “feels better” decisions.

You have no ground truth for optimisation.

2. Improved Hybrid Plan (What You Should Actually Build First)
Optimised for your coding tool.
No documentation content.
Focused purely on Trackback sentiment.

Phase 0 — Build the Evaluation Backbone (Mandatory)
Everything rests on this.

Your coding tool should generate:

A structured CSV/Sheet template with columns for:

post_text

parent_text (if available)

has_brand (true/false)

sentiment_label (neg/neu/pos)

actionability_label (0–10)

topic_label

vendor_output

model_output

model_confidence

notes

Label 100–200 historical posts manually with CS + Compliance input.

This becomes your frozen test set.

Phase 1 — Lightweight Deterministic Pre-filter (v1)
Your coding tool should implement simple, deterministic rules:

1. Spam & Promo Filters
Remove posts dominated by:

giveaway/promo language

generic SEO spam

crypto promos

hashtag walls

emoji-only posts

link-only posts unless sentiment keyword exists

2. Short-Post Heuristic (smart version)
Replace your old hard cut (“≥12 words”) with:

If token_count < 4:
    If strong_negative_keyword detected:
        send to LLM judge
    Else:
        ignore as noise
3. Brand / Link relevance rule
Keep the core idea:

must contain brand name
OR

link that resolves to a known brand domain
OR

parent_text contains brand name

This gives you the best of both worlds — avoids noise but doesn't drop real negatives.

Phase 2 — Optional Context Enrichment (Only when we have data)
Your coding tool should:

Detect whether parent_text exists.

If not → send only post_text.

If yes → prepend parent_text into structured LLM input.

The LLM prompt should be context-flexible.

Phase 3 — LLM Judge (using an improved version of Gemini’s prompt)
Use the Risk & Action Judge as the core decision engine, but with these improvements:

Add fields
"confidence": 0.0–1.0

"relevance_to_brand": true/false

Tighten topic list
Keep only essential actionable categories.

Require short rationale for debugging
20 words max.

Strengthen the Vendor Noise Filter
Specify more examples based on your real Trackback dataset.

Your coding tool can generate the final version of this system prompt.

Phase 4 — Integration & Thresholding
Only create an Action Card when:

confidence ≥ threshold (e.g. 0.75)

actionability_score ≥ threshold (e.g. 6+)

relevance_to_brand = true

This ensures:

High precision
Low false alarm rate
No overload for CS teams

Phase 5 — Optional future stage (not for v1)
(Your coding tool should NOT implement now.)

Add small triage model (Gemma 2B, Llama 3.2 3B, etc.)

Add correction feedback loop.

Add retraining pipeline.

These come only after you measure v1’s uplift vs vendors.
